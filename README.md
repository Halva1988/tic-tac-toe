#### Description:

**Overview**
> This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid with 'X' and 'O' symbols. The main goal is to achieve a winning pattern before the opponent.

### Project Files
#### index.html
> The main HTML file serves as the entry point for the game. It includes the structure of the game board, the score display, and the modal for game results. This file orchestrates the connection between the game logic (JavaScript) and the visual representation (CSS).

##### style.css
> The CSS file defines the styling for the game interface. It handles the layout, appearance, and responsiveness of the game board, score display, modal, and the "New Game" button. It uses background images to enhance the visual experience.

#### app.js
> The JavaScript file contains the core logic of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It manages the game state, handles player moves, checks for a winner or a draw, updates the scores, and controls the display of the modal. Additionally, it enables interaction between the game board and the user.

#### Game Logic
> The game follows standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules, where players take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell. The game checks for a winning pattern after each move and displays a modal announcing the winner or a draw. Players can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button.

#### Modal
> The modal appears at the end of each game, displaying the result. It dynamically changes its background image based on the game outcome ('X' wins, 'O' wins, or a draw). The modal also contains a "New Game" button to initiate a fresh game.

#### Responsive Design
> The project incorporates responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless gaming experience on various screen sizes. The layout adjusts to provide an optimal view on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Usage
1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. Two players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their symbols.
3. The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
4. The modal displays the result, and players can start a new game.
